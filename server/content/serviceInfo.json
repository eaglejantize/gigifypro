      "expanded": "<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Work confidentially with proposer to plan surprise engagement or other significant life surprises (pregnancy announcements, homecoming reveals, adoption celebrations). Scout locations, coordinate timing, arrange decorations, hire photographer/videographer, manage logistics, and ensure everything unfolds perfectly.

Confirm all vendor timing 48 hours before and day-of morning. Have contingency plans for weather, location closures, or surprise recipient schedule changes. Coordinate with venue staff or security when working in semi-private spaces (restaurants, hotels). Brief all helpers on their roles and timing—practice if possible. Stay in communication via phone or radio during execution. Never pressure surprised person to respond certain way—emotions vary. Respect if they need private moment before photographs. Ensure proposer has realistic expectations—surprises don't always go exactly as planned. Document all agreements in writing to protect against miscommunication.</p><p><strong>Pricing Model:</strong> Consultation and basic planning: $200–$500 for location recommendations and timeline creation.
