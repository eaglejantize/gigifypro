You are an expert full-stack engineer auditing the GigifyPro project after a large sprint.

GOAL
Surface all major changes, wire any missing mounts/links, ensure DB migrations and seeds are applied, and verify pages show real data.

TASKS (do in order; report each step)
1) GIT & FILE AUDIT
- Print a concise tree of added/edited files since the prior commit (or last 24h).
- List newly added routes files under server/routes/* and utils, services, content.
- List new client pages under client/src/pages and new components.

2) ROUTE MOUNTS
- Open server/routes.ts (or the central API index) and CONFIRM mounts exist for:
  /api/explore/*, /api/partners/*, /api/gsquare/*, /api/content/testimonials, /api/profile/*, /api/admin/*
- If any missing, add them (import + api.use).

3) DB MIGRATIONS & SEEDS
- Run: npx prisma generate
- Run: npx prisma migrate dev -n "audit_apply"
- Run seeds if present (create if missing):
  - server/scripts/seedBadges.ts
  - server/scripts/seedTopics.ts
  - NEW: server/scripts/seedStore.ts → inserts products: chef_hat, chef_jacket, cleaning_apron, reflective_jacket, laundry_bag_kit with placeholder images from client/public/store/*
  - NEW: server/scripts/seedGSquare.ts → creates 20 demo users (fake), ~200 posts spread across the last year with mixed topics and service tags.
- Execute: npx ts-node server/scripts/seedBadges.ts
- Execute: npx ts-node server/scripts/seedTopics.ts
- Execute: npx ts-node server/scripts/seedStore.ts
- Execute: npx ts-node server/scripts/seedGSquare.ts

4) NAVBAR & ROUTING LINKS
- Ensure top-nav includes links (visible):
  Home, Services, Knowledge, Explore, Store, G-Square
- If missing, edit the Navbar component and add routes:
  /explore, /store, /gsquare
- Ensure client router has routes for:
  /explore, /store, /gsquare, /admin/analytics, /admin/payments

5) CACHING & REBUILD
- Clear server in-memory caches (restart server).
- Confirm server sets ETag/Cache-Control for knowledge/testimonials.
- Rebuild client if needed and restart dev processes.

6) PLACEHOLDER ASSETS
- Verify placeholders exist:
  client/public/store/chef-hat.png
  client/public/store/chef-jacket.png
  client/public/store/cleaning-apron.png
  client/public/store/reflective-jacket.png
  client/public/store/laundry-bag-kit.png
- If missing, generate neutral placeholders with G Pro logo overlays (note in code that they’re temp).

7) EXPLORE PAGE CHECK
- Confirm /explore page renders filters:
  Category, Service, Location (zip/city/state), Sort (Top Ranked, Highest Rated, Price Low–High, Price High–Low, Most Recent)
- Ensure it calls /api/explore/top with pagination and shows:
  Services Completed, Avg Rating, Response Time, Member Since, GigifyPro Score + Elite badge if score ≥90.

8) KNOWLEDGE HUB CHECK
- Confirm reorganized tabs present:
  Business Setup & Compliance, Skill & Service Training, Skill Builder Sessions, Partner Integrations
- Ensure /api/partners endpoints exist with PARTNER_FEE_PERCENT env default and stub handler.

9) G-SQUARE (COMMUNITY) CHECK
- Confirm /gsquare renders seeded posts (images/text), reactions, comments.
- Ensure “Local/Nationwide” toggle appears and operates (query filter).
- Admin moderation routes under /api/admin/gsquare respond.

10) OUTPUT A VERIFICATION REPORT
- Print:
  - Routes mounted: ✅/❌ per mount
  - # of products in store
  - # of explore results for a sample query (e.g., service=lawn-care, location=90210)
  - # of knowledge modules per tab
  - # of G-Square posts last 30 days
- Provide a checklist with direct links:
  /explore
  /store
  /knowledge
  /gsquare
  /admin/analytics
  /admin/payments

NOTES
- Do not remove existing content. Make additive, safe edits.
- Keep placeholder imagery tasteful; mark TODO for real photos.
- If any environment variables missing, create .env.example entries and explain what to add to Replit Secrets.

Return a concise summary of what changed and what was verified, with any TODOs.
