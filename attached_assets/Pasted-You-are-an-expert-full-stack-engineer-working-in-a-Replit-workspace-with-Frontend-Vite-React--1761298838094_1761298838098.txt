You are an expert full-stack engineer working in a Replit workspace with:
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript (client/)
- Backend: Express + TypeScript (server/)
- DB: Prisma + PostgreSQL (already set up)
- Existing features: Auth, Store skeleton, Listings

OBJECTIVE
Add a production-ready Knowledge Hub and an Info Icon system with real content (no placeholders), place the brand slogan sitewide, and add merch items (Laundry Bag Kit, Chef Jacket, Chef Hat). Provide exact file paths, create missing folders/files, and confirm builds start cleanly.

============================================================
A) BRAND SLOGAN PLACEMENT
============================================================
1) Edit the site header (or landing hero) to include the brand slogan.

File: client/src/components/Navbar.tsx (or your global header/landing component; if Navbar doesn’t exist, use your main layout)
- Insert a subtle banner below the nav bar:

// --- insert near top-level render, under nav header ---
<div className="bg-blue-50 border-b border-blue-100 text-blue-900 text-center text-sm py-2">
  <strong>Learn. Earn. Get Gigified.</strong> — Turn everyday skills into income, independence, and freedom.
</div>
// ---

2) If you have a landing hero (e.g., client/src/pages/Home.tsx or client/src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx), add the slogan subtitle under the H1:
<p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
  <strong>Learn. Earn. Get Gigified.</strong> — When you’re Gigified, you set your schedule, grow your brand, and even build a team.
</p>

============================================================
B) KNOWLEDGE HUB (pages + API + content)
============================================================
We’ll implement an API that serves articles and service info from a typed content module (no DB migration needed now). Frontend will fetch and render.

1) SERVER: Content source (real copy)
Create file: server/content/knowledge.ts
----------------------------------------------------------------
export type KnowledgeArticle = {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  body: string; // HTML-safe string (basic markup)
  category: "business" | "safety" | "service";
  badges?: string[];
};
export type ServiceInfo = {
  key: string;                 // e.g., "lawncare"
  label: string;               // e.g., "Lawn Care"
  summary: string;             // hover text (~1-3 lines)
  expanded: string;            // full HTML-friendly description
  recommendedGear?: string[];
  requirements?: string[];
  badges?: string[];
};

export const articles: KnowledgeArticle[] = [
  {
    slug: "what-does-gigified-mean",
    title: "What Does It Mean to Be Gigified?",

  <li><strong>Certified:</strong> Pass background checks and complete category training.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliant:</strong> Upload business license/insurance (where required).</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Add sub-gigers (helpers/trainees) as demand grows.</li>

    summary:
      "Neighborhood laundry made professional: pickup → wash → dry → fold → return. Branded bag system prevents mix-ups.",
    body: `
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Customers pre-sort into four GigifyPro bags: Whites, Colors, Linens, Intimates (mesh wash-in bag). You pick up, wash, dry, fold, and return — each set stays in its bag, so there's no mixing or sorting later.</p>
<p><strong>Why customers love it:</strong> No sorting, less risk of mix-ups, and consistent results. Intimates stay protected in the mesh bag through wash/dry.</p>
<p><strong>Why gigers love it:</strong> Clear process, repeat subscriptions, and easy branding.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended gear:</strong> GigifyPro Laundry Bag Kit (4 bags), gentle + hypoallergenic detergents, garment steamer (optional), folding surface, vehicle liners.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing ideas:</strong> By bag, by pound, or subscription (weekly/bi-weekly). Offer express add-on and stain-treatment upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>Hygiene & safety:</strong> Use clean machines; separate loads by customer; disinfect between jobs; communicate allergies/sensitivities. Follow local laundry/handling guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Certification:</strong> <em>“Laundry Giger Certified”</em> after sanitation module + supply setup.</p>

  <li><strong>Deliver prepped meals:</strong> Prepare in your kitchen or licensed space and deliver sealed, labeled meals for the week.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Compliance & safety:</strong> Upload food-handler certificates (e.g., ServSafe) and follow local health codes. Sanitize surfaces, prevent cross-contamination, label allergens and dates. Some regions require licensed/commercial kitchens for off-site prep — check local rules in the Knowledge Hub “Local Law & Licensing Map”.</p>
<p><strong>Branding & gear:</strong> Chef jacket, hat/cap, waterproof apron, temperature-safe carriers, compostable containers, labeling printer.</p>

6) CLIENT: Use Info icons in service menus
- Wherever you render service names (e.g., category pickers, listing cards, booking forms), import and place:
  <span className="inline-flex items-center">
    <span>Lawn Care</span>
    <InfoPopover serviceKey="lawncare" />
  </span>

Repeat with keys: "meal-prep", "laundry-fold", "childcare", "handyman", "massage", "personal-trainer", "personal-shopper", "maid-service", "event-planner", "gift-buyer", "transportation", "senior-checkin".

7) CLIENT: Routes for Knowledge pages
In your router (e.g., client/src/App.tsx), add:
  <Route path="/knowledge" component={Knowledge} />
  <Route path="/knowledge/article/:slug" component={KnowledgeArticle} />

============================================================
C) STORE: Add Laundry Bags + Chef Uniforms
============================================================
We will upsert 3 more products into the existing store.
