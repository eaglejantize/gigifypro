Perfect — you want to expand your Explore page’s service selector into a scrollable + searchable dropdown list that covers every major category of services while keeping your “Popular” ones (Home Repair, Personal Chef, Fitness Training, House Cleaning).

Here’s exactly what to give your Replit Agent to build this feature:

⸻

🧠 Replit Agent Prompt — Step 1 of 4

Task: Add a scrollable, searchable service-category dropdown to the Explore page, plus extend the category list used on the Post-a-Gig page.

Visitors can pick from a comprehensive list of service categories when posting or browsing gigs.

	•	Searchable (type-ahead filter)
	•	Reusable (shared between /explore and /dashboard/giger/gigs/new)
	•	Styled with shadcn/ui + Tailwind (rounded, shadowed, consistent with site theme)

	•	Scrollable list of all categories above
	•	Returns selected category slug/text
	2.	Integrate into Explore page
	•	File: app/explore/page.tsx
	•	Add a “Select Category” dropdown at top of filter bar
	•	When user selects a category → filters visible gigs by that category (/api/gigs?category=<slug>)
	3.	Integrate into Post-a-Gig form
	•	File: app/dashboard/giger/gigs/new/page.tsx
	•	Replace plain text input with the same dropdown
	4.	Seed popular categories
	•	Update /dev/seed to insert these base categories if not existing
	5.	Style
	•	Limit height ≈ 400 px (max-h-[400px] overflow-y-auto)
	•	Rounded corners, soft shadow, large clickable rows
	•	Search input placeholder: “Search services…”
	6.	Optional
	•	Persist last-selected category in localStorage
	•	Highlight “Popular Categories” at top with divider

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	Dropdown opens smoothly and is scrollable.
	•	Typing filters the list in real time.
	•	Selecting a category updates Explore filter and Gig-creation form.
	•	Existing popular categories still visible as featured cards.
	•	Works on desktop and mobile.

⸻

When you paste this into Replit Agent, label it:
Prompt → “Gigify Explore Service Dropdown Enhancement — Step 1 of 4.”

Once it completes, we’ll proceed to Step 2 of 4: category-based filtering and routing so Explore dynamically loads matching gigs.
