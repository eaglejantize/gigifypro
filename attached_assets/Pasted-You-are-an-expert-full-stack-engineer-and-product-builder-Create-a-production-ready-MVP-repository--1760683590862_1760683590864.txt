You are an expert full-stack engineer and product builder. Create a production-ready MVP repository named "gigifypro" for a gig-economy + social hybrid platform. Tech stack: 
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript), TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, React Query, NextAuth (credentials now; OAuth-ready later). 
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11), SQLModel + Alembic for Postgres migrations, JWT auth (python-jose), Pydantic v2, httpx.
- DB: PostgreSQL. 
- Dev: Docker Compose (web, api, db), .env.example, Makefile, pre-commit hooks (black, isort, ruff), CI (GitHub Actions) that runs lint/test on PRs.
- Payments: Stripe test-mode placeholders + dependency inversion so we can switch later.
- Messaging: basic in-app chat (API endpoints + simple UI).
- Notifications: table + API; real-time later (WebSocket placeholder).
- “Likes = reviews” model: each “like” on a completed job or on a worker’s listing counts as a positive review signal (with optional text review). Ranking weights: LIKE_WEIGHT=1.0, RATING_WEIGHT=2.5, RECENCY_DECAY=0.85^(weeks_since), RESPONSE_BONUS for fast responders. Provide a reusable ranker function.

Repository structure:
- /api  (FastAPI app)
  - main.py
  - core/ (config, security)
  - models/ (sqlmodel tables)
  - schemas/ (pydantic models)
  - routers/ (auth, users, services, listings, jobs, bookings, reviews_likes, chat, payments, notifications)
  - services/ (ranking.py, payments.py, search.py)
  - migrations/ (alembic)
  - tests/
- /web  (Next.js app)
  - app/ (routes: landing, feed, explore, post, listing/[id], profile/[id], inbox, dashboard, auth, settings)
  - components/, lib/, hooks/, styles/
- /shared  (types/ contracts shared between web and api)
- /ops (docker-compose.yml, Makefile, scripts/)
- /.github/workflows (ci.yml)
- README.md, LICENSE (MIT), .pre-commit-config.yaml, .editorconfig

Core entities (minimum viable):
- User (both sides; worker has WorkerProfile)
- WorkerProfile (skills, bio, hourly_rate; default pricing logic uses $25 per 30 min anchor)
- ServiceCategory (e.g., lawn care, meal prep, childcare, chefs, trainers, handymen, massage, personal shopper, laundry+fold, maid service, event planner, gift buyer, transportation/errands, light senior care)
- ServiceListing (worker publishes offerings)
- JobRequest (client posts the task request)
- Booking (the contract; state: requested → accepted → in_progress → completed → cancelled)
- ReviewLike (a “like” that may include optional comment + 1–5 star rating)
- Message (simple threaded chat under a booking)
- Notification (generic)
- Payout (stub for Stripe Connect later)
- Dispute (stub)

Pricing logic:
- Default anchor: $25 per 30 minutes. Implement helper `pricing.quote(duration_minutes, base_anchor=25)` that calculates cost in half-hour blocks with a simple tier:
  - 0–30 min = $25
  - 31–60 min = $50
  - Thereafter ceil(n/30)*$25 (service can override via WorkerProfile.hourly_rate or ServiceListing.custom_rate).
- Store “quoted_total” on Booking at creation.

Ranking:
- Implement services/ranking.py with function `rank_workers(worker_metrics)` that returns a score per worker using:
  score = LIKE_WEIGHT*like_count + RATING_WEIGHT*avg_rating*reviews_count^0.5
  Then multiply by recency decay for last 8 weeks activity and add small response-time bonus.
- Expose GET /services/search?query=…&sort=ranked to use the ranker.

Auth flows:
- NextAuth credentials (email+password) now; social OAuth later.
- API JWT bearer for mobile/third parties.
- Basic RBAC: user, worker, admin.

Key endpoints (create routers with stubs + minimal logic):
- POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login
- GET/PUT /users/me
- POST /workers/profile (create/update)
- GET /services/categories
- CRUD /listings
- POST /jobs (client posts a task request)
- POST /bookings (creates booking from a listing or job request)
- PATCH /bookings/{id}/accept | /start | /complete | /cancel
- POST /reviews-likes (like with optional comment & rating 1..5)
- GET /workers/{id}/rank
- Chat: POST /chat/threads (by booking), POST /chat/messages
- Payments: POST /payments/intent (stub), POST /payouts (stub)
- Notifications: GET /notifications (stub)

Frontend pages (simple but shippable):
- Landing: clear CTA “Post a task” or “Offer your services”.
- Feed (ranked): shows top local listings by ranking score; each card shows like count, star rating, price anchor.
- Post a Task wizard: category → details → time window → address → budget (shows computed quote).
- Listing page: “Like” (review-lite), book button, chat after booking.
- Profile page: shows likes, ratings, badges, response time.
- Inbox (chat), Dashboard (jobs, earnings), Settings.

Developer ergonomics:
- One command to run all: `make dev` (starts docker compose web+api+db).
- Seed script to create categories and a few demo users/listings.
- .env.example with WEB_URL, API_URL, POSTGRES settings, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, STRIPE_TEST_KEYS.

Deliverables & acceptance:
1) Full repo with working docker compose: `docker compose up` yields web at http://localhost:3000, api at http://localhost:8000, db on 5432. First boot auto-runs migrations, seeds categories.
2) Minimal e2e: Register → create worker profile → publish listing → client posts job → create booking → complete → leave “like+rating” → listing shows updated rank/score in Feed.
3) Unit tests for ranking, pricing, and bookings state machine.
4) README with step-by-step run + deploy notes.

After creating the repo, output:
- Exact tree
- All generated .env.example values
- The local URLs
- The first admin credentials (seed)
- The Makefile targets
