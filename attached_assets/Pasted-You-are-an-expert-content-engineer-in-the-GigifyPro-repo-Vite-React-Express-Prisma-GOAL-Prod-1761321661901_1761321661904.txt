You are an expert content engineer in the GigifyPro repo (Vite React + Express + Prisma).

GOAL
Produce a single, downloadable JSON file containing ALL GigifyPro services (target: 75), each with:
- key (kebab-case, unique)
- label (title-cased)
- category (one of: Home & Living; Cleaning & Detailing; Food & Hospitality; Errands & Transportation; Outdoor & Yard Care; Family & Child Services; Senior & Care Companion; Pet Services; Creative, Media & Event Services; Personal Growth & Lifestyle; Business & Digital Support; Art, Design & Custom Creations)
- summary (2–3 sentence quick overview)
- expanded (HTML-safe guide with sections: How It Works; Tools & Startup Gear; Certifications & Requirements; Safety & Best Practices; Pricing Model; Upsell & Business Growth; Get Gigified Badge)
- recommendedGear (string[])
- requirements (string[])
- badges (string[])

IMPORTANT
- Do NOT overwrite existing project files yet. First, create a downloadable file and display its link.
- Validate:
  - No duplicate keys
  - All fields present for every service
  - category values from the allowed list only
- After I approve, replace/merge into `server/content/serviceInfo.json` with shape: `{ "services": [ ... ] }`

SCOPE
Include the entire catalog:
- Everything already present in the project (current count shows 56 services total)
- Add the remaining **19 Home & Living** entries to bring Home & Living to 28
- Ensure recently added categories/services are included:
  - Pet Services (Dog Walking & Sitting, Dog Yard Cleanup, Pet Hair Cleanup, Pet Taxi & Drop-In)
  - Errands & Transportation (incl. Mobile Oil Change & Basic Car Maintenance)
  - Art, Design & Custom Creations (Artist / Painter; Custom Clothing Designer; Furniture Maker / Refinisher; Home Decor & Design Giger; Upcycled Art & Reclaimed Creations)
  - Creative, Media & Event Services (Birthday Surprise Delivery; Costume & Prop Maker; Custom Gift Basket Creator; Event Planner; Memorial & Gravesite Care; Personal Videographer; Pop-Up Party Host; Proposal or Surprise Planner; Social Media Moments)

CONTENT QUALITY
- Keep summaries concise and useful.
- In `expanded`, include short, actionable paragraphs for each section (HTML-safe: <p>, <ul>, <li>), but keep the total per service reasonable (~150–250 words) so the file stays reviewable.
- Where regulation matters (e.g., Mobile Oil Change, Childcare, Massage), include brief, generic compliance notes (no legal advice).

PROCESS
1) Gather the current services from `server/content/serviceInfo.json` if exists.
2) Build a master array for all 75 services. Fill in missing ones with new entries.
3) Validate uniqueness of `key` and category enum values.
4) Write the result to a new file at project root:
   - `gigifypro-services-draft.json`
   - Shape: `{ "services": [ ...75 items... ] }`
5) Provide a downloadable link to that file in Replit.
6) WAIT for my approval.

ON APPROVAL (DO NOT RUN UNTIL I SAY “APPROVED”)
- Backup existing: copy `server/content/serviceInfo.json` to `server/content/serviceInfo.backup.json` (create folder if missing)
- Replace with the new file contents (rename/merge to maintain shape: `{ "services": [...] }`)
- Run quick sanity checks:
  - Can GET `/api/knowledge/services` and get an array with 75 items
  - Spot check a few `/api/knowledge/services/:key` responses (e.g., `lawncare`, `maid-service`, `personal-videographer`)
- Output a brief summary: total services, categories covered, and any keys that were normalized.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- A downloadable `gigifypro-services-draft.json` link is shown
- JSON validates (no duplicates, categories in allowed list, fields present)
- No project files overwritten until I say “APPROVED”
