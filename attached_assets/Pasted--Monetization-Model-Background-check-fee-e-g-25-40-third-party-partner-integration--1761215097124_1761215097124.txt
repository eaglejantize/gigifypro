🧠 Safety & Liability Recommendations (for your consideration)

Meal Prep:
	•	Require Gigers to check a “Food Safety Acknowledgment” box before activating this category.
	•	Offer upload field for ServSafe certificate or equivalent.
	•	Display “Food Safety Verified” badge for compliant Gigers.

Lawncare:
	•	Require “Equipment Use Agreement” for shared-equipment jobs (digital checkbox).
	•	Optional “Equipment Insurance” add-on if Gigify partners with a micro-insurer.

All Gigs:
	•	Require customer signature on completed job (digital acknowledgment).
	•	Maintain basic $1M platform liability coverage (later partnership with Insurtech).

🧰 Technical Implementation (for the app build)
	•	Database tables: KnowledgeArticle, Certification, Badge, UserBadge, TrainingProgress
	•	UI Sections:
	•	/knowledge (Hub home)
	•	/knowledge/article/:slug (article detail)
	•	/knowledge/certifications (badges + progress)
	•	/knowledge/resources (state-by-state license map)
	•	Admin Panel: for you or staff to add new resources and link external licensing tools.
	•	Gamification: visual progress bar “You’re 75% Gigified!”

🧱 Next Step Options

Now that we have the blueprint, I can:
	1.	Write the in-app Knowledge Hub text content (the articles and lessons for each section)
	2.	Create a Replit Agent prompt to build the Knowledge Hub skeleton in your app (React + Express + Prisma modules with placeholder lessons, badges, and progress tracking)

⸻

👉 Which do you want next:
	•	A) The Replit Agent prompt to add the Knowledge Hub structure (ready for app integration), or
	•	B) The written content (the actual articles and lesson drafts) for your first 5 Knowledge Hub topics
