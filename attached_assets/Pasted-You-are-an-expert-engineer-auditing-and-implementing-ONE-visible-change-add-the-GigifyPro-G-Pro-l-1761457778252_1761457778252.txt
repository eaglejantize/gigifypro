You are an expert engineer auditing and implementing ONE visible change: add the GigifyPro “G Pro” logo overlay to the homepage hero image.

OBJECTIVE
- Find the homepage hero component.
- Add a visible logo overlay on the hero (top-left on the worker’s shirt area; if exact spot is tricky, place top-left of hero section).
- Add placeholder logo asset(s) if missing.
- Rebuild and provide verification steps + file paths changed.

DO (IN ORDER) AND REPORT EACH STEP

1) LOCATE HOMEPAGE / HERO
- Search for likely files and print which exist (✅/❌):
  client/src/pages/Home.tsx
  client/src/pages/home/Home.tsx
  client/src/components/Hero.tsx
  client/src/components/sections/Hero.tsx
  client/src/App.tsx (to confirm route for “/”)
- Open the file that renders the homepage and print the component name and a 10-line code excerpt around its <main> or hero markup.

2) ADD/VERIFY ASSETS
- Ensure these assets exist (create if missing with simple neutral placeholders):
  client/public/brand/gpro-logo.svg
  client/public/brand/gpro-logo.png
- If no hero background image is used, skip. If a hero image file is referenced (e.g., /hero/hero.jpg), leave it as-is and just overlay logo absolutely.

3) IMPLEMENT LOGO OVERLAY
- In the hero section wrapper, add a positioned overlay container:
  <div className="pointer-events-none absolute left-4 top-4 z-20">
    <img src="/brand/gpro-logo.svg" alt="GigifyPro" className="h-10 w-auto drop-shadow" />
  </div>
- If the hero component is in a separate file (Hero.tsx), add the overlay there.
- Ensure the hero wrapper has `relative` class so absolute positioning works.
- Do NOT break existing layout; make minimal edits.

4) OPTIONAL: “Shop the Look” CTA (non-blocking)
- If the hero already has CTAs, skip.
- Else add a small link button under the hero heading:
  <a href="/store" className="inline-flex items-center rounded bg-blue-600 px-3 py-1.5 text-white text-sm mt-3">Shop the look</a>

5) BUILD TAG (VISUAL PROOF)
- If client/src/components/BuildTag.tsx does not exist, create:
  ------------------------------------------------
  export default function BuildTag(){
    const ts = new Date().toLocaleString();
    return <div className="fixed bottom-2 right-2 z-50 rounded bg-black/75 text-white text-xs px-2 py-1">GP Build · {ts}</div>;
  }
  ------------------------------------------------
- Mount <BuildTag/> near the root (e.g., in App.tsx) so we can verify a fresh build on the page.

6) REBUILD & OUTPUT
- Run: npm run build (or the project’s build command) then start dev.
- Print:
  - The exact file(s) edited (paths).
  - A short snippet of the hero with the overlay code block.
  - Confirmation that /brand/gpro-logo.svg exists.
  - The current timestamp (should match BuildTag on the page).

7) VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS (PRINT THESE)
- Open “/” in the preview.
- Hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R).
- Confirm:
  - You see the “GP Build · <timestamp>” tag in bottom-right.
  - The G Pro logo is visible at the top-left of the hero section.
- If the logo is missing, print the computed page HTML around the hero container to help troubleshoot.

END.
