PROJECT: GigifyPro (Modern Gig-Economy Ecosystem)

GOAL:
Implement the following upgrades across the **UI, Store, Explore, Knowledge Hub, and Community/Social system** to prepare for final launch.

====================================================
A) BRAND + STORE INTEGRATION

   - Overlay logo on:
     • Worker shirts (home hero section)
     • Chef hat and chef jacket
     • Cleaning apron
   - Generate two versions:
     • “G Pro” text-based (bold, modern)
     • Circular “G” emblem variant for embroidery overlays.

2. Create and add the following **branded store products**:
   - Chef Hat (with embroidered G Pro logo)
   - Chef Jacket (with embroidered G Pro logo)
   - Cleaning Apron (with printed G Pro logo)
   - Reflective Safety Jacket (with reflective G Pro logo)
   - Laundry Bag Kit (proprietary GigifyPro-branded kit)
     • Includes: whites bag, colors bag, linens bag, washable intimates mesh bag.
     • Add product copy describing professional home service utility and durability.

3. Update the **Store Page UI**:
   - Categorize as: “Apparel”, “Safety Gear”, “Tools & Kits”
   - Each product card: image, description, price, availability, “Add to Cart” button.

4. For placeholder items, generate temporary mock images with logo overlays in `client/public/store/`.
