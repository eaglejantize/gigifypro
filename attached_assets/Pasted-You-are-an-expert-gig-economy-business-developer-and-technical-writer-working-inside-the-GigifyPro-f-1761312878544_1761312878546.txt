You are an expert gig-economy business developer and technical writer working inside the GigifyPro fullstack app project.

GOAL:
Begin building the **Knowledge Hub business guides** for each GigifyPro service category, starting with the **Pet Services** category. These guides will be displayed in the “Knowledge” section and accessed via each service’s info icon (“i”) and detail modal.

CATEGORY: 🐾 Pet Services
SERVICES:
1. Dog Walking & Sitting
2. Dog Yard Cleanup (Pooper Scooper)
3. Pet Hair Cleanup
4. Pet Taxi & Drop-In

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
For each service listed above, generate a structured Knowledge Hub entry containing the following fields:

- **title**: Full name of the service
- **summary**: 2–3 sentence quick overview (used for hover popovers)
- **expanded**: Multi-section HTML-safe detailed description covering:
  1. How It Works — explain the process clearly
  2. Tools & Startup Gear — list affordable, accessible items
  3. Certifications & Requirements — note background checks, insurance, or local rules
  4. Safety & Best Practices — emphasize customer trust and animal well-being
  5. Pricing Model — suggest example pay rates and recurring options
  6. Upsell & Business Growth — show how to scale, offer subscriptions, or expand
  7. Get Gigified Badge — give each a unique badge name and explain what it represents

- **recommendedGear**: List form of essential tools
- **requirements**: List of legal or suggested qualifications
- **badges**: 1–2 badge titles related to training or excellence

FORMAT:
Return the result as an array of JSON objects, each representing a full Knowledge Hub entry, formatted and ready for insertion into:
`server/content/serviceInfo.json` and the “Knowledge Hub” database.

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
{
  "key": "dog-walking-sitting",
  "label": "Dog Walking & Sitting",
  "summary": "Trusted pet companions who provide walks, care, and company while you’re away.",
  "expanded": "<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Tools & Startup Gear:</strong> ...</p><p><strong>Certifications & Requirements:</strong> ...</p>...",
  "recommendedGear": ["Leash", "Dog waste bags", "Reflective vest", "Pet-safe wipes"],
  "requirements": ["Background check", "Pet care orientation", "Local leash laws compliance"],
  "badges": ["Certified Pet Giger", "Safety Verified"]
}

Once the Pet Services category is complete, summarize key insights and prepare to continue with the **next category: Errands & Transportation** upon user confirmation.

IMPORTANT:
- Write in warm, instructive language that motivates independent Gigers to take pride in professionalism.
- Assume readers have no prior business experience.
- Use HTML-safe formatting (<p>, <ul>, <li>) for the expanded sections.
- Ensure all examples and advice comply with U.S. legal norms for independent gig work.
- Keep tone consistent with GigifyPro’s brand voice: *Friendly, educational, empowering.*
