IMPORTANT COMPLIANCE NOTES (apply where relevant):
- Mobile Oil Change & Basic Car Maintenance:
  * Limit to basic, non-licensed tasks (oil/filter changes, wiper/air filter swaps, fluids top-off, tire pressure).
  * Include environmental compliance guidance: used oil collection, disposal via approved facilities, spill kits, absorbents, local regulation awareness (EPA/state).
  * Prohibit work in prohibited zones (e.g., HOA/municipal restrictions) and advanced mechanical/diagnostic tasks unless properly certified and insured.
- Prescription Pickup Buddy:
  * Require verified ID/background check, client consent, and pharmacy pickup protocols (privacy, correct handoff).
- Ride Along Companion / Transportation & Errands:
  * Require valid driver’s license, insurance, vehicle safety checklist; clarify wait-time policy, tolls, and mileage.
- Driveway Snow Shoveling:
  * Weather safety, slip risk warnings, de-icer handling, PPE.

TONE & STYLE:
- Warm, instructive, empowering; assume readers are first-time business owners.
- Use clear, actionable steps.
- Ensure all examples and advice comply with typical U.S. norms for independent gig work.

FORMAT:
Return a single JSON array of objects, one per service, ready for insertion into:
- server/content/serviceInfo.json (summary/expanded/recommendedGear/requirements/badges)
- Knowledge Hub DB (title/summary/body/category/badges)

AFTER YOU FINISH:
